Data description
----------------

### Data Sources

Data is provided and has been uploaded as the file Data_for_A_Pleasure_That_Hurts_replication.dta 

### Analysis Data Files

- [ ] Analysis data files mentioned, provided. File names listed below.
> > find . Data_for_A_Pleasure_That_Hurts_replication.dta 

Data deposit
------------

Code description
----------------
There are seven files. 
1. One provided Stata file. 
2. One Stata do file.
3. One pdf guide.
4. Four Stata .ado files.

Stated Requirements
---------------------

You should create an empty folder called "tables" within that folder; some of the tables will be outputted in that directory as .tex files in addition to being printed out in Stata.

- [ ] Software Requirements 
  - [ ] Stata
    - command outreg2. (run the following command in Stata: ssc install outreg2)

Computing Environment of the Replicator
---------------------

  > INSTRUCTIONS: This might be automated, for now, please fill in manually. Remove examples that are not relevant, adjust examples to fit special circumstances. Some of this is available from the standard log output in Stata or R. Some frequently used details are below. Some of these details can be found as follows:
>
> - (Windows) by right-clicking on "This PC"
> - (Mac) Apple-menu > "About this Mac"
> - (Linux) see code in `tools/linux-system-info.sh`

- Mac Laptop, MacOS 10.14.6, 8 GB of memory
- CISER Shared Windows Server 2019, 256GB, Intel Xeon E5-4669 v3 @ 2.10Ghz (3 processors)
- CISER Virtual Windows Server 2016, 16GB, Intel Haswell 2.19 Ghz (2 processors)
- BioHPC Linux server, Centos 7.6, 64 cores; 1024GB RAM; 

> INSTRUCTIONS: Please also list the software you used (specific versions). List only the ones you used, add any not listed in the examples:

- Stata/MP 14

Replication steps
-----------------

1. Downloaded the data file, the do file and the ado files and save in the same folder.
2. Crate a new folder named "tables"
3. Change the direction of the file in the do file. use YOURLOCATION, clear where YOURLOCATION is the specific location in your computer.
4. In many parts of the code you will find the following: "{outregpath}" substitute it by "YOURLOCATION\tables\" 
5. Install the packages outreg and outreg2. Use: ssc install outreg and ssc install outreg2
6. Run the ado files.
7. Run the do file. 

Findings
--------

> INSTRUCTIONS: Describe your findings both positive and negative in some detail, for each **Data Preparation Code, Figure, Table, and any in-text numbers**. You can re-use the Excel file created under *Code Description*. When errors happen, be as precise as possible. For differences in figures, provide both a screenshot of what the manuscript contains, as well as the figure produced by the code you ran. For differences in numbers, provide both the number as reported in the manuscript, as well as the number replicated. If too many numbers, contact your supervisor.

1. Cannot produce Table 3. 

### Data Preparation Code

Examples:

- Program `1-create-data.do` ran without error, output expected data
- Program `2-create-appendix-data.do` failed to produce any output.

### Tables

Examples:

- Table 1: Looks the same
- Table 2: (contains no data)
- Table 3: Minor differences in row 5, column 3, 0.003 instead of 0.3

### Figures

> INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide a comparison with the paper when describing that figures look different. Use a screenshot for the paper, and the graph generated by the programs for the comparison. Reference the graph generated by the programs as a local file within the repository.

Example:

- Figure 1: Looks the same
- Figure 2: no program provided
- Figure 3: Paper version looks different from the one generated by programs:

Paper version:
![Paper version](template/dog.jpg)

Figure 3 generated by programs:

![Replicated version](template/odie.jpg)

### In-Text Numbers

> INSTRUCTIONS: list page and line number of in-text numbers. If ambiguous, cite the surrounding text, i.e., "the rate fell to 52% of all jobs: verified".

[ ] There are no in-text numbers, or all in-text numbers stem from tables and figures.

[ ] There are in-text numbers, but they are not identified in the code

- Page 21, line 5: Same


Classification
--------------

- [ ] full reproduction with minor issues

I was able to produce all the tables of the papers.

Problems:
1. Table 1: as explained in the "guide" in order to generate columns 1 and 2, we need to access another database. For this reason, as expected we can only produce columns 3-5.
2. Table 5: Some standard errors were different to the ones presented in the paper.
